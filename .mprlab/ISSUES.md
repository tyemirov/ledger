- [ ] [M001R] (P2) Backlog hygiene and archive.
  Goal:
  Keep the issue tracker reliable, readable, and focused on active work while preserving resolved history in the appropriate archive.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run weekly during active development and before each release cut.
  - Validate section names, identifier prefixes, recurrence suffixes, priority markers, dependencies, and duplicate IDs against the current `issues-md-format.md`.
  - Reconcile stale statuses, duplicate issues, broken references, obsolete instructions, and entries filed under the wrong section.
  - Move completed non-recurring history to the repository issue archive or durable documentation when the active tracker becomes noisy.
  - Keep active, blocked, planning, and recurring entries visible in `ISSUES.md`.
  Deliverables:
  - Normalized `ISSUES.md` structure and statuses.
  - Updated issue archive or docs when completed entries are removed from the active tracker.
  - A short `Last run:` note summarizing the cleanup and any follow-up issues filed.
  Validation:
  - Re-read `ISSUES.md` after edits and confirm every issue is under the right section with a unique section-aware ID.
  - Confirm recurring entries remain open and keep the `R` suffix.
  - Confirm no active, blocked, recurring, or planning work was archived.
  Last run: 2026-08-09.
- [ ] [M002R] (P2) Polish open issues.
  Goal:
  Keep unresolved work executable by making each open issue concrete, ordered, and testable.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run weekly during active development and before handing a repo to automated execution.
  - Review every unresolved non-recurring issue for missing context, dependencies, repro steps, acceptance criteria, and validation expectations.
  - Make priorities concrete and ensure each open issue has actionable deliverables.
  - Merge duplicate open issues or add explicit dependency links when separate entries must remain.
  - Do not close or implement issues as part of this polish pass unless that work is separately requested.
  Deliverables:
  - Open issues with enough detail for a person or agent to execute without rediscovery.
  - New or updated dependency markers where ordering matters.
  - A short `Last run:` note listing the number of issues polished and any blockers found.
  Validation:
  - Sample the open entries after the pass and confirm each has clear next actions and validation expectations.
  - Confirm no recurring runbook was marked complete.
  - Confirm duplicates were merged or explicitly cross-referenced.
- [ ] [M003R] (P2) Architecture and policy review.
  Goal:
  Catch architecture, policy, and workflow drift before it becomes hidden maintenance debt.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run monthly, before large refactors, and after major framework or runtime changes.
  - Review the codebase, docs, and workflow against `AGENTS.md`, `POLICY.md`, stack guides, and the current architecture notes.
  - Look for drift from forward-only contracts, edge-validation boundaries, smart-constructor usage, testing policy, and module ownership.
  - Record findings as new Maintenance issues with concrete scope, priority, and validation.
  - Close the pass with a no-action note only when the review finds no actionable drift.
  Deliverables:
  - New Maintenance issues for each actionable architecture or policy drift finding.
  - Updated notes on areas reviewed and areas intentionally left unchanged.
  - A short `Last run:` note with the review scope and outcome.
  Validation:
  - Confirm every finding is represented as an issue with owner-readable context and validation criteria.
  - Confirm no implementation changes were mixed into the review runbook unless separately requested.
  - Confirm all recurring runbooks remain open.
- [ ] [M004R] (P1) Dependency and security audit.
  Goal:
  Keep third-party dependencies, runtime versions, and security-sensitive configuration within the current supported contract.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run weekly for active apps and before each release cut.
  - Inspect package managers, lockfiles, language toolchains, container bases, and generated clients for known vulnerabilities or stale direct dependencies.
  - Review auth, secret, CORS, CSP, SQL, network, and permission-sensitive configuration for drift from the current contract.
  - Prefer current supported dependencies; do not add compatibility shims for obsolete dependency behavior.
  - File separate Maintenance or BugFix issues for each actionable vulnerability, unsupported runtime, or security-contract gap.
  Deliverables:
  - Documented audit commands or data sources used for the pass.
  - Updated issues for each actionable dependency or security finding.
  - A short `Last run:` note with clean result or follow-up issue IDs.
  Validation:
  - Rerun the repository-native audit, lint, or dependency checks used for the pass.
  - Confirm every finding is either filed, fixed under a separate issue, or explicitly marked not applicable with evidence.
  - Confirm no secrets or private payloads were written into the tracker.
- [ ] [M005R] (P1) CI, release, and artifact health.
  Goal:
  Keep the repository's validation, release, publication, and generated artifact surfaces trustworthy.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run before every release, publish, or deploy, and weekly for critical services.
  - Verify repository-native CI, lint, format, coverage, release, publish, Docker image, Pages, and artifact workflows still match the documented contract.
  - Check generated artifacts, release tags, published images, and Pages outputs for source-to-public drift.
  - File concrete follow-up issues for failing gates, stale artifacts, missing release prerequisites, or undocumented workflow changes.
  - Do not perform production deployment from this runbook unless the operator explicitly requests that deployment.
  Deliverables:
  - Recorded gate status and artifact surfaces inspected.
  - Follow-up issues for each reproducible CI, release, publish, or artifact drift problem.
  - A short `Last run:` note with commands run and any skipped surfaces.
  Validation:
  - Use repository-native `make` targets or documented release helpers for checks.
  - Confirm release and deployment ownership boundaries remain separate.
  - Confirm public or published artifacts match the intended source revision when that surface is inspected.
- [ ] [M006R] (P1) Code contract and static hygiene.
  Goal:
  Keep source contracts explicit, current, and statically guarded against policy drift.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run monthly and before large refactors.
  - Scan for dead code, unused exports, duplicated literals, silent fallbacks, legacy aliases, compatibility reads, and zero-but-invalid domain states.
  - Check static analysis, coverage, schema, and contract guards that are supposed to prevent drift.
  - File focused Maintenance issues for each concrete violation instead of broad cleanup placeholders.
  - Keep the current canonical contract only; do not preserve obsolete behavior unless a product requirement explicitly says so.
  Deliverables:
  - Issue entries for each actionable static hygiene or contract violation.
  - Notes on static tools, searches, and contract guards used during the pass.
  - A short `Last run:` note with clean result or follow-up issue IDs.
  Validation:
  - Rerun the relevant static checks, contract tests, or repository searches used to identify drift.
  - Confirm every finding has a narrow follow-up issue and does not duplicate existing backlog work.
  - Confirm no implementation changes were mixed into the audit unless separately requested.
- [ ] [M007R] (P1) Production drift and health.
  Goal:
  Detect when production, public, or scheduled runtime state has drifted from the intended repository contract.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run weekly for deployed services and after each publish or deploy.
  - Compare current source, runtime configuration, published images, public routes, scheduled jobs, and health checks for drift.
  - Inspect real operator-facing surfaces rather than assuming merged source is deployed.
  - File follow-up issues for stale images, stale Pages output, missing routes, failed monitors, invalid production config, or undocumented runtime differences.
  - Stop before production deploy or destructive operator actions unless the operator explicitly requests them.
  Deliverables:
  - Recorded source revision, public artifact, route, image, or health surfaces inspected.
  - Follow-up issues for each source-to-runtime drift finding.
  - A short `Last run:` note with evidence links or commands used.
  Validation:
  - Verify inspected production or public surfaces directly where access is available.
  - Confirm any deploy-required finding is filed with the exact publish/deploy boundary and owner.
  - Confirm no production state was changed by the audit unless explicitly requested.
- [ ] [M008R] (P2) Documentation and runbook hygiene.
  Goal:
  Keep durable documentation and runbooks aligned with the current behavior users and operators actually rely on.
  Requirements:
  - Cadence: run before release cuts and after merge bursts that change user-facing or operator-facing behavior.
  - Review README, ARCHITECTURE, PRD, CHANGELOG, docs, runbooks, setup guides, and local workflow notes for stale behavior or missing new contracts.
  - Update docs when closed issues changed durable behavior, public APIs, operator workflows, release semantics, or deployment expectations.
  - Remove or rewrite stale instructions instead of preserving obsolete alternatives.
  - File separate issues for documentation gaps that require product or implementation decisions.
  Deliverables:
  - Updated documentation or filed follow-up issues for each gap.
  - A short `Last run:` note listing docs inspected and changes made.
  - Cross-references from archived issue history to durable docs when useful.
  Validation:
  - Check links, command names, paths, and public contract descriptions touched by the pass.
  - Confirm docs describe the current canonical path only.
  - Confirm issue archive and active tracker references remain consistent.
- [x] [M009R] (P0) Increase test coverage to 95%.
  Resolved: ledger tests expanded to 96.7% coverage; coverage gate raised to 95%, tooling passing.
  Increase test coverage to 95%
- [x] [M010R] (P0) Enforce coverage gate across the entire Go module.
  Resolved: `make test-unit` now computes module-wide coverage (excluding generated `api/credit/v1`); service/store integration tests added; `make ci` passing with total coverage 95.2%.
  - Current `make test` only enforces coverage for `pkg/ledger`, leaving `cmd/credit` + `internal/*` effectively untested.
  - Update coverage gate to measure module-wide coverage (excluding generated protobuf package) and add integration tests that exercise the service end-to-end.
- [x] [M011R] (P1) Fix demo backend Docker build failing due to outdated ledger proto dependency.
  Resolved: bumped `demo/backend` dependency on `github.com/MarkoPoloResearchLab/ledger` so generated proto includes `tenant_id`/`ledger_id`; `go test ./...` and demo `docker build` passing.
  - `demo/backend` imports `github.com/MarkoPoloResearchLab/ledger/api/credit/v1` but pins an older module version missing `tenant_id`/`ledger_id` fields, breaking `demo/Dockerfile` builds.
  - Update `demo/backend/go.mod` to a ledger module version that matches the current API and ensure `demo/docker-compose.yml` builds succeed.
- [x] [M012R] (P1) Fix demo Compose TAuth container failing to start without config.yaml.
  Resolved: added `demo/tauth.config.yaml` + compose mount and `TAUTH_CONFIG_FILE`; updated demo UI to load `tauth.js` from TAuth and aligned demo issuer to `tauth`.
  - Current `demo/docker-compose.yml` uses `ghcr.io/tyemirov/tauth:latest`, which now requires a YAML config file (defaults to `config.yaml`) and exits if it is missing.
  - Provide a minimal demo `config.yaml` and wire it into compose via volume mount + `TAUTH_CONFIG_FILE`.
- [x] [M013R] (P1) Demo UI: apply missing styles and fix TAuth script load order so wallet/actions work.
  Resolved: added `demo/ui/styles.css`; updated `<mpr-header>` to `tauth-*`/`google-site-id`/`tauth-tenant-id`; ensured `tauth.js` is present before `mpr-ui.js` boots; UI now renders balances and disables actions until authenticated; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
  - Demo page currently renders largely unstyled because it uses custom classnames without a CSS file.
  - `mpr-ui` auth bootstrap expects `window.initAuthClient` to exist when `mpr-ui.js` runs; the current dynamic loader can race and prevent auth events (wallet never loads).
- [x] [M014R] (P1) Demo stack: serve the UI over HTTPS on `:4443` via ghttp using the computercat TLS cert/key and proxy auth/API routes through the same origin.
  Resolved: ghttp now terminates TLS on host `:4443` using `demo/certs`, proxies `/api` + TAuth routes, and demo docs/config derive base URLs from the current origin; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
  - Replace the HTTP-only `:8000` demo UI entrypoint with `https://localhost:4443`.
  - Wire ghttp TLS with the `computercat-cert.pem` / `computercat-key.pem` pair and proxy `/api`, `/auth`, `/me`, `/tauth.js` to the backing services.
- [x] [M015R] (P1) Demo stack: make TAuth cookies host-only so auth works on `computercat.tyemirov.net` and LAN origins.
  Resolved: demo TAuth `cookie_domain`/`APP_COOKIE_DOMAIN` now empty (host-only), so cookies are issued for the active origin; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M016R] (P1) Demo stack: ensure Postgres schema is migrated by GORM when running Compose.
  Resolved: `demo/docker-compose.yml` now builds `ledgerd` from the repo `Dockerfile` (includes I011 Postgres `AutoMigrate`) so fresh Postgres volumes get tables automatically; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M017R] (P1) Demo UI: keep mpr-ui and page styles on the same light/dark theme (avoid mixed palettes).
  Resolved: `data-mpr-theme` is now the single source of truth (set on `<html>`/`<body>` and toggled via the footer theme switcher); custom demo CSS now keys off `data-mpr-theme`; `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M018R] (P2) Demo UI: remove the header Account/settings button.
  Resolved: removed `<mpr-header>` settings attributes so the Account button no longer renders; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M019R] (P2) Demo UI: square theme switcher should expose four modes (not two).
  Resolved: footer theme-config now defines 4 modes (default-light, sunrise-light, default-dark, forest-dark) and demo CSS keys palette overrides off `data-demo-palette`; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M020R] (P2) Demo UI: show account details (photo/name/email) from the header user menu; remove the hero session card.
  Resolved: added a user-menu action that opens an account-details modal; removed the session card; Playwright coverage added; `make ci` + `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M021R] (P1) Demo UI: footer theme switcher does not switch themes.
  Resolved: header now uses the same 4-mode theme-config as footer so themeManager config isn't overridden; Playwright coverage added; `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M022R] (P2) Demo UI: "Docs" header link should open the rendered integration guide (not the GitHub repo root).
  Resolved: header now points to `docs/integration.md` on GitHub; Playwright coverage added; `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M023R] (P2) Demo UI: footer links menu should match the mpr-ui demo site catalog ("Built by Marco Polo Research Lab").
  Resolved: footer dropdown updated to the mpr-ui site catalog; Playwright assertions added; `cd demo && make ci` passing.
- [x] [M024R] (P1) Enforce production-only unused-code gates in CI.
  Resolved: `make ci` now runs `staticcheck`/`errcheck` without tests, checks production reachability via `deadcode` + package-deps validation, and verifies `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds; removed unreachable `internal/store/pgstore` and updated docs.
